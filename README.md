# Atlas
## Inspiration
Imagine a world where you can make financial promises with someone and can be guaranteed that it will be kept. This is the world that smart contracts promise us. However, not everyone is able to understand the code that smart contracts are written in. We want to make smart contracts accessible to the average person, as believe that promises should be simple and easy to understand.

## What it does
It takes a short clip of spoken words and transforms it into smart contract that is virtually incorruptible on the Hedera blockchain.

## How we built it
Node.js for driving everything.
Assembly and Open AI for transcription and parsing spoken word.
Wonderful UI mockups made on Figma.
Hedera's Hashgraph SDK.
Good ol' front end dev

## Challenges we ran into
Working in different time zones! Vancouver, Japan, and the Philippines! 
Understanding blockchains, smart contracts, and the Hashgraph SDK! Even as fairly technical students we were stumped.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The spoken language to text feels like magic!
Extract of meaning behind ownership from text feels like magic!
Working as a team with half designers and half developers

## What we learned
Javascript is full of tricks and traps for the unwary!
How to record audio and send it to a node.js server
A little bit more how smart contracts work!

## What's next for Atlas
MORE TYPES OF CONTRACTS. Mortgages, secured loans, crowdfunding just to name a few.
